  **Design Movement**: "Digital Hygge" / "Soft Skeuomorphism"
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile Warmth**: The interface should feel like paper, fabric, or organic materials, not cold glass.
  2. **Intimate Scale**: Elements should feel personal and hand-held, avoiding sprawling layouts.
  3. **Slow Tech**: Interactions should encourage pausing and reflection, not speed.
  4. **Organic Imperfection**: Lines should wobble slightly; grids shouldn't be perfectly rigid.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Intent**: Evoke the feeling of a cozy, safe space for private thoughts.
  - **Palette**: Warm off-whites (paper), deep indigo (ink), soft sage greens (growth), and muted terracotta (earth).
  - **Reasoning**: High contrast black/white is too clinical. Deep indigo on warm cream feels like a classic fountain pen on quality paper.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **The Journal Spread**: Instead of a dashboard, the main view mimics an open book or a desk surface.
  - **Scattered Garden**: The year view isn't a strict grid but a "garden bed" where days are planted in organic clusters (still chronological but visually softer).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Paper Texture Background**: Subtle grain that reacts to "light" (scroll position).
  - **Hand-Drawn Borders**: Containers have imperfect, sketched outlines.
  - **Ink Bleed Effects**: Selected states look like ink soaking into paper.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Deliberate Action**: Buttons have a "press" depth; saving an entry feels like stamping or sealing.
  - **Growth Feedback**: Completing an entry triggers a gentle "sprouting" animation, not a flash.

  **Animation**:
  - **Frame-by-Frame**: Animations (like the plant growing) should feel like stop-motion or flip-book sketches (12fps), not smooth 60fps tweens.
  - **Drift**: Floating elements (clouds, leaves) move with slow, non-linear paths.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Patrick Hand* or *Amatic SC* (Handwritten feel but legible).
  - **Body**: *Nunito* or *Quicksand* (Rounded sans-serif that complements handwriting without being hard to read).
  - **Hierarchy**: Size and weight denote importance, but color remains consistent (ink).

  **Design Movement**: "Ethereal Minimalism" / "Dreamscape"
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Weightlessness**: The interface should feel airy and floating.
  2. **Luminous**: Elements glow rather than having hard outlines.
  3. **Fluidity**: Transitions are liquid and seamless.
  4. **Focus**: The content (memory) is the only solid thing; everything else is atmosphere.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Intent**: Create a dream-like state where memories are preserved in light.
  - **Palette**: Pale lavenders, misty blues, soft whites, and iridescent accents.
  - **Reasoning**: To differentiate from the "earthy" original app while keeping the "growth" metaphor, but shifting it to a "sky garden" or "constellation" theme.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **The Constellation**: The year view is a star map. Each day is a star; filled days shine brighter.
  - **Floating Cards**: Entry modals float in the center with blurred backdrops.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass layers for depth.
  - **Glowing Dots**: The "seeds" or "stars" emit a soft light.
  - **Gradient Meshes**: Backgrounds are slow-moving, subtle color shifts.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Ripple Effects**: Clicks create water-like ripples.
  - **Fade In/Out**: Elements don't slide; they materialize and dissolve.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow & Smooth**: All movements are heavily eased and slow (duration > 0.5s).
  - **Breathing**: Interactive elements gently scale up and down when idle.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Cormorant Garamond* (Elegant, airy serif).
  - **Body**: *Lato* (Light weight, clean sans-serif).
  - **Hierarchy**: Use opacity and letter-spacing rather than bold weights.

  **Design Movement**: "Neo-Brutalist Notebook" / "Raw Sketch"
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Honesty**: Show the structure; no hiding behind gradients.
  2. **Boldness**: High contrast, thick lines, assertive typography.
  3. **Playfulness**: Unexpected colors and shapes.
  4. **Utility**: It's a tool first, decoration second.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Intent**: To make journaling feel active and energetic, not just passive reflection.
  - **Palette**: Stark white background, pure black lines (#000), and vibrant highlighter colors (neon yellow, cyan, magenta) for accents.
  - **Reasoning**: Mimics a student's notebook with highlighters and sharpies.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **The Grid**: A strict, visible grid system (graph paper).
  - **Modular Blocks**: Content lives in clearly defined boxes with thick borders.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hard Shadows**: Buttons and cards have solid black drop shadows (no blur).
  - **Graph Paper Background**: Subtle grid lines everywhere.
  - **Sticker Aesthetic**: The "plants" look like stickers placed on the grid.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap**: Interactions are instant and snappy (no ease-in-out).
  - **Hover States**: Elements invert colors or shift position abruptly on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Panels slide in from edges with 100% opacity.
  - **Glitch/scribble**: Loading states look like scribbling.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Mono* or *Courier Prime* (Monospace, typewriter feel).
  - **Body**: *Inter* (Tight, legible, utilitarian) or *Space Grotesk*.
  - **Hierarchy**: All caps for headers, distinct size differences.
